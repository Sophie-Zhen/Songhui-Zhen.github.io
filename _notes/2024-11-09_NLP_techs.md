Useful website: [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
### Part 2: Types of preprocessing
#### 1. Tokenization: tokens vs. types
#### 2. Normalization: lemmatization, morphology, stemming, punctuation, case-folding
  * lemmatization: __Lemma__ is the __dictionary form__ of a word, so lemmatization reduces a word to its base word but __preserves its meaning__, based on the context and grammar.
  * morphology: Morpheme is the __smallest__ meaningful __unit__ in a word, including roots, suffixes, and prefixes, morphology breaks down the word to morpheme.
  * stemming: Stem is the __root__ of a word, stemming reduces the word to its root, by __chopping off endings__ without considering context, it’s more __mechanical__.
  * Attention: difference between lemma and stem
#### 3. Sentence Splitting: sentence segmentation
  * Unambiguous: ! ?
  * Ambiguous: full stop”.”
  * Sentence boundary
  * Abbreviations like Inc. or Dr.
  * Numbers like 0.02%
  * Build a __binary classifier__ to distinguish between __unambiguous and ambiguous__.
  * __Decision tree__: if-then-else statement, choosing the proper features
  * Decides EndOfSentence(__EOS__) or NotEndOfSentence(__NEOS__)
### Part 3: N-gram Language Model
